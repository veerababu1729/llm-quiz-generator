      "question": "What is the principle of wave-particle duality?",
      "type": "short answer",
      "answer": "It states that every particle or quantum entity exhibits both wave and particle properties.",
      "explanation": "Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics."

      "question": "Which of the following is an example of quantum entanglement?",
      "type": "multiple choice",
      "options": [
        "Two electrons sharing the same orbit",
        "Two particles whose states are dependent regardless of distance",
        "A photon passing through a slit",
        "A neutron decaying into a proton"
      ],
      "answer": "Two particles whose states are dependent regardless of distance",
      "explanation": "Entanglement means the state of one particle instantly influences the other, no matter the distance."
